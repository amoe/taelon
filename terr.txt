Essentially:
There are exFOO.txt for every FOO.txt included with the terrorists.
These exFOOs are the distributed files, same as the backup - no they're not
The FOO.txts are then copied into dark/deftxt
Some FSMs and AIPs are copied to dark/aip
The installer extracts the zip to dark/addon/terr

dark/deftxt:
animate.txt
build.txt
damage.txt
overlay.txt
ovleff.txt
trneff.txt
units.txt
weapon.txt


dark/local:
mlstring.cfg

dark:
packman.cfg (packman.ter)

These files all need to be backed up, so we can create a mirror of this tree
in dark/addon/terr/backup
The installer also allows to save & restore terr configuration - we do not need
to support this

terr.cfg and terr.ftg need to go in dark/addon/terr

Strangely GAMEMSG.TXT is not copied anywhere.  Is it redundant?










































FIXME:

- If terr uninstall is done with an installation created by the Windows
  batchfile installer, it will fail since the backups won't be found.  Also if
  it has been done manually.  This is obvious I think.
