POLICY
------
When the installation is as simple as unzipping the file to a certain game
directory, I don't provide an installer.

For instance, here's how to install the map "Jake":

unzip -d ~/win/programs/dkreign/dark/scenario/multi 02jake.zip

Fairly simple, eh?


FAN BLADE ATTACK BOAT
---------------------
The directory hierarchy is contained in the zipfile itself (if only Auran had
adopted this method for all the units).  To install, just do the following:

unzip -d ~/win/programs/dkreign fanblade.exe

Beware that in contrast to other units, the Fanblade will install a multiplayer
custom mission rather than a single player one.


TERRORISTS SIDE
---------------
Use "taelon terr" to manipulate it.
The Terrorists work fine with v1.4.
