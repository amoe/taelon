POLICY
------
When the installation is as simple as unzipping the file to a certain game
directory, I don't provide an installer.

For instance, here's how to install the map "Jake":

  unzip -d ~/win/programs/dkreign/dark/scenario/multi 02jake.zip

Fairly simple, eh?


FAN BLADE ATTACK BOAT
---------------------
The directory hierarchy is contained in the zipfile itself (if only Auran had
adopted this method for all the units).  To install, just do the following:

  unzip -d ~/win/programs/dkreign fanblade.exe

Beware that in contrast to other units, the Fanblade will install a multiplayer
custom mission rather than a single player one.


TERRORISTS SIDE
---------------
Use "taelon terr" to manipulate it.
The Terrorists work fine with v1.4.
Don't try to use 'terr' to uninstall the Terrorists as installed by 'terr.bat'
on Windows; it will not work, and may break catastrophically (though probably
not).  Only use 'terr uninstall' when 'terr installl' has been used previously.


INSTALL UNITS
-------------
To install a unit:

  taelon unit ~/win/programs/dkreign gore.zip

where 'gore.zip' is the zipfile containing the unit you want to install.

Be warned that units will only appear in one scenario named after the unit by
default, these are accessible under 'Single player' > 'Play custom mission'.
Manual editing is required to add a specific unit to all missions;
alternatively, installing the Combo Pack adds a large subset of available
third-party units & buildings to all missions.

There's no particular requirement to uninstall units installed through 'taelon
unit', since they take minimal space, only appear in their scenario, and do not
inhibit multiplayer with stock installations.  However, it's simple to uninstall
them manually:

  rm -r ~/win/programs/dkreign/dark/addon/gore
  rm -r ~/win/programs/dkreign/dark/scenario/single/gore


COMBO PACK
----------
Install the combo pack:

  taelon combo install ~/win/programs/dkreign combo.exe

Uninstall it and revert to normal:

  taelon combo uninstall


SPRITE UTILITIES
----------------
Since source wasn't provided for these command-line utilities, you can run them
with Wine.  'makesprite.exe', 'makerow.exe', 'makepal.exe', 'mkcursor.exe',
'maketiles.exe', and 'showsprite.exe' are available at <GAME>/dark/sprutils.
